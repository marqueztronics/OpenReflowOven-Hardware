# Open Reflow Oven

A reflow oven controller to be used with regular electric toaster ovens.

PCB designed in Altium CircuitStudio.

Current status: Finished v1.0 PCB layout. Tested with some basic reflows.

Note: If you are looking for schematics, Gerber, BOM, etc. they are under the "Default Configuration" folder. Circuit Studio has a weird directory structure.
